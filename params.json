{"name":"Eienteirl","tagline":"this is a guide to make this game playable for everyone who wants to play it","body":"#Simple Guide\r\nThis is a guide to make this game more playable and less confusing and less exasperating.\r\n\r\n##Where to download?\r\nI publish all the releases through github releases. Simply go there to download:\r\n\r\nIf you want to find the 7DRL version, then: [v7drl-b](https://github.com/BakaBBQ/EienteiRL/releases/tag/v7drl-b) is your way to go.\r\n\r\nIf you want to find a less bugged, more fun version, then you should download the [latest version](https://github.com/BakaBBQ/EienteiRL/releases).\r\n\r\nWindows and OS X builds are avaliable.\r\n\r\nFor linux, you need to run from source. Thus you have to\r\n\r\n - clone this repo\r\n - install ruby (> 1.9 is recommended)\r\n - install [gosu](http://www.libgosu.org)\r\n - go to the root directory of the game and run `ruby Main.rb`\r\n\r\n##Basic Controls\r\n\r\n - __[vi-keys or numpad]__ movement\r\n - __[f]__ primary shot\r\n - __[q,w,e,r]__ corresponds to the four skills you have\r\n - __[< or ,]__ ascend to next floor (at stairs)\r\n - __[d]__ use the current card (see the _Deck_ section for more info)\r\n - __[s]__ shift to the next card \r\n\r\n##ASCII Legends (Only contains those alien to typical rogue-likes)\r\n\r\n - __*__ (in various colors) bullet (graze them)\r\n - __●__ another kind of bullet\r\n\r\n##Abnormality\r\n\r\nWhen you start a game (after class selection), the screen will be empty, simply press any direction key to normally\r\nstart the game.\r\n\r\nWhen you ascend to next floor, the screen will not update, you can also just press any direction key to update the screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Mechanics\r\n\r\n - Your __hp should be more than zero__ to survive.\r\n - Auto gameover if time reaches __5:00 AM__.\r\n - Killing Kaguya at floor 15 entails winning.\r\n \r\n - Your primary shot __[f] costs 5 mp__.\r\n - All of your skills __[q,w,e,r] costs 10 mp__.\r\n - Every turn you regenerate 1 mp.\r\n \r\n - Time starts at __2:00AM__ .\r\n - Time flows (at a quite slow rate).\r\n - The more np (night point) you have, the slower time flows.\r\n - Night points decrease rapidly (1 point per turn) when no enemies are around.\r\n - Night points decrease slowly when enemies are near.\r\n \r\n - Point items (blue \"p\") increase your score and increase your np by 5 points.\r\n - Power items (red \"p\") heals you for a small amount.\r\n - Night items (red \"n\") increase you np by 20 points.\r\n - Card items (purple \"c\") draws a card from a deck.\r\n \r\n - There is no way to save your game\r\n - Permadeath\r\n \r\n##Bullets\r\nBullets don't behave like actual bullets (as in the shooter games), for they are not for you to actually dodge.\r\nRather they are only there for forcing you to move (or in fighter game jargons, they are there for zoning purposes),\r\nyou can graze bullets (destroy them) by moving thru them, that means: __as long as you keep moving, these bullets cannot hit you__.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, sometimes bullet spamming enemies will be paired up with melee-centered enemies, and that is the real problem.\r\n\r\n##Deck & Profile\r\nThe only way to upgrade your ability is thru your decks. Every time you pick up a \"c\" item, you draw one card from you deck.\r\nWhen a game starts, your profile (\"~/EienteiRL/profile.rb\" on unix and \"%userprofile%/EienteiRL/profile.rb\" on windows) is loaded.\r\nPressing __d__ uses the current card, which will provide you with either an upgrade in skill, or an upgrade to your mhp or mmp.\r\n\r\nSkills can have a max level of four, and you can bring more than four cards for the same skill (though it would be a waste of card),\r\nyou should only bring skills for your own class (that means you can bring other classes' skills as well, but it would be considered cheating).\r\nOnly bring 10 cards per deck.\r\n\r\n##Skills Info\r\n>Note: this was meant to be in game description (currently not because I ran out of time)\r\n\r\n###Classes\r\n####Gardener\r\n| Skill                       | Code Name (use this in your profile) | Description                                            | Derives from
